# ATM-Simulator-System
The "ATM Simulator System" is a desktop-based application created using Java, leveraging Swing and some AWT components. It incorporates JDBC to establish a connection with a MySQL database. The project offers a user-friendly interface, beginning with a signup page for new users. Once registered and logged in, users can manage their accounts through various internet banking features, including Deposit, Cash Withdrawal, Fast Cash, Mini Statement, PIN Change, and Balance Enquiry. This system effectively simulates the functionalities of a real ATM, making it a valuable tool for learning and practicing financial transactions.
